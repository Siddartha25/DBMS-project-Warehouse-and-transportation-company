# DBMS-project-Warehouse-and-transportation-company
This project was done as a part of my DBMS course 

In this project I implemented a database allows the proper maintenance of various components of the business such as transportation, storage, customer details, seller details, employee details etc

Created a relational schmea for all the componets of the database and set up dependancies among all the components and also normalised the database to remove redundancy and reduce space wastage
